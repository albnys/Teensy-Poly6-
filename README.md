Teensy-Poly6

This is a polyphonic synth that I programmed and built from scratch.
By request, I have now posted the code and Schematics although it´s really ugly. So look at it on your own risk heh.
Hope it´s useful to somebody.

The synth is built using a teensy 3.5 and is programmed in Arduino IDE using the teensy audio library.
